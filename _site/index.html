<figure><img class="docimage" src="images/ai_bio_cover.png" alt="Image of futuristic AI and Biological specimens" style="max-width: 400px" align="right" /></figure>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research has existed since at least the 1950s. After initial enthusiasm, the gains of early years slowed and AI entered what has been referred to as an AI winter. Modern computing hardware, rapid growth in data collection and availability, and advances in algorithms have renewed interest in AI and revolutionized the field. AI is rapidly becoming ubiquitous in daily life and in diverse academic fields. This course will examine the applications of AI with particular focus on applications in biology. We will address the topics of what AI is, how intelligent computers really are and may become, where limitations still exist, and how AI technologies can be used to advance biological research.</p>

<p>The course will attempt to provide sufficient background and foundations so that students understand AI algorithms at a conceptual level, but will not focus on the mathematical details. This is not a computer science or mathematics course.</p>

<p>Classes will have some lecture, though most classes will consist of live coding demos and hands-on exercises.</p>

<p><strong>About:</strong>  Dr Gitzendanner’s background is in plant evolutionary genetics and genomics where he uses genetic tools to study the conservation, evolution, and diversity of plants. The field is generally computationally intensive, and Matt has worked for 10 years training users how to use HiPerGator and other high-performance computing systems to do the amazing research that is done across the University of Florida campus.</p>

<p>The initial version of this course, taught in Spring 2021, was co-developed with <a href="https://github.com/stuckyb">Brian Stucky</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to this course, Matt teaches</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://comptoolsres.github.io/">Computational Tools for Research in Biology (BSC4452/6451)</a></li>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<h3 id="computer-programming">Computer programming</h3>

<p>The course assumes a <strong>basic understanding of computer programming</strong> in general, and Python in particular.</p>

<p>If you have not taken a programming course or are new to Python, there are several LinkedIn Learning courses that will give you sufficient background to be ready for this course (these are free for UF Students):</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> Note, you do not need to do all of these. Any <strong>one</strong> would get you at a good place to start the semester. We will review the basics of Python in the first weeks.</div>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fprogramming-foundations-fundamentals-3%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&amp;account=41282748">Programming Foundations: Fundamentals</a>
    <ul>
      <li>This course is best for people with no coding experience.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Another option for those with some coding experience</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="math">Math</h3>

<p>You should have a <strong>general understanding of probability and statistics</strong> at the level of a first applied statistics course.</p>

<p>Knowledge of basic calculus and, to a lesser extent, linear algebra, can be helpful. We won’t focus on the math, but having a conceptual understanding of derivatives, function optimization, and matrix math will be useful.</p>

<p>If you are unsure, contact the instructor.</p>

## Course Policies

### Class Attendance and Makeup Policy

Requirements for class attendance and makeup assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found in the online catalog at: [https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/)

In general, I do not take attendance. You are all adults and I assume you are taking the class the learn. **The best way to learn is to regularly attend class.** I are sure students will miss class for various reasons. I am happy to help you catch up. If you regularly miss class and fall behind, I may ask that you hold questions on content you have missed until after class, or ask that you coordinate a time to go over the content. I will make every effort to record and post all classes to help those that miss classes.

### Assignment Policy

Assignment dates will be announced at least one week in advance and students will have at least three days to complete the assignment. Each assignment will clearly state if it is an individual or group assignment.  Individual assignments must be the student’s own work, completed without the assistance of others.

All assignments are "open book, open internet", you may use whatever resources you desire to complete the assignment. Though only assignments specifically noted as group assignments should be worked on with other people.

### Makeup and Late policy

Please notify the instructor of circumstances that lead to late work or missed classes. I will generally work with you and accept late work. All assignments are designed for both your own learning and my assessment of your efforts. Much of the course builds on previous sections and falling behind on assignments will make it harder to keep up. If you need help, please ask! **My goal is for all students to learn the material** and I understand that some students will need more help than others. The grade is based on the end product, not the amount of time and help needed to get there.

___
## Students Requiring Accommodations

Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with the Disability Resource Center (352-392-8565, [https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/)) by providing appropriate documentation. Once registered, students will receive an accommodation letter which must be presented to the instructor when requesting accommodation. Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early as possible in the semester.

___
## Course Evaluation

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional and respectful manner is available at [gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/). Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or via [ufl.bluera.com/ufl/](https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/). Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at [gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/).

___
## Class Demeanor and Netiquette

Students are expected to be in class on time and behave in a manner that is respectful to the instructors and to fellow students.

Opinions held by other students should be respected in discussion, and conversations that do not contribute to the discussion should be held at minimum, if at all.

Students should be working on course content during class.

### Discussion Boards

The [GitHub discussion boards](https://github.com/AIBiology/aibiology.github.io/discussions) can be used to ask for and provide help by all. Students should be supportive and considerate of others at all times. Rude or inappropriate comments will be removed and the poster will be warned.

___
## University Honesty Policy

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states:
&gt;We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: “On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.”

[The Honor Code](https://sccr.dso.ufl.edu/policies/student-honor-code-student-conduct-code/) specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and the possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel. If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with the instructor or TAs in this class
