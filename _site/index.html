   <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<figure><img class="docimage" src="images/ai_bio_cover.png" alt="Image of futuristic AI and Biological specimens" style="max-width: 400px" align="right" /></figure>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research has existed since at least the 1950s. After initial enthusiasm, the gains of early years slowed and AI entered what has been referred to as an AI winter, with limited progress or research for decades. Modern GPU technology and advances in algorithms has renewed interest in AI and revolutionized the field. AI is rapidly becoming ubiquitous in daily life and in diverse academic fields. This course will examine the applications of AI with particular focus on applications in Biology. We will address the question of what is AI, how intelligent computers really are and may become, where limitations still exist, and if AI is here to stay or the latest trend.</p>

<p>The course will attempt to provide sufficient background and foundations so that students understand the detailed workings of the AI algorithms, but will not focus on the mathematical details. This is not a computer science or mathematics course. Calculus and Linear algebra are foundational to AI, but we will gloss over the details as much as possible and students are not expected to have background knowledge of these fields.</p>

<p>Classes will have some lecture, though most classes will consist of live coding demos and hands-on exercises.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The course assumes a basic understanding of computer programming, and Python in particular.
If you have not taken a programming course or are new to Python, there are several LinkedIn Learning courses that will give you sufficient background to be ready for this course:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fprogramming-foundations-fundamentals-3%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&amp;account=41282748">Programming Foundations: Fundamentals</a>
    <ul>
      <li>This course is best for people with no coding experience.</li>
      <li>Most of the hands-on examples are in Python</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2/welcome?u=41282748">Python Essential Training</a>
    <ul>
      <li>A good review or introduction for people who know some programming but not Python</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

*Another option for those with some coding experience 
Note, you do not need to do all of these. Any one would get you at a good place to start the semester. We will review the basics of Python in the first weeks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>

<h3 id="class-attendance-and-makeup-policy">Class Attendance and Makeup Policy</h3>

<p>Requirements for class attendance and makeup assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found in the online catalog at: <a href="https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/">https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/</a></p>

<p>In general, we do not take attendance. You are all adults and we assume you are taking the class the learn. <strong>The best way to learn is to regularly attend class.</strong> We are sure students will miss class for various reasons. We are happy to help you catch up. If you regularly miss class and fall behind, we may ask that you hold questions on content you have missed until after class, or ask that you coordinate a time to go over the content. We will make every effort to record and post all classes to help those that miss classes.</p>

<h3 id="quiz-and-assignment-policy">Quiz and Assignment Policy</h3>

<p>Quiz and assignment dates will be announced at least one week in advance and students will have at least three days to complete the quiz or assignment. Each quiz or assignment will clearly state if it is an individual or group assignment.  Individual assignments must be the student’s own work, completed without the assistance of others.</p>

<p>All quizzes and assignments are “open book, open internet”, you may use whatever resources you desire to complete the quiz/assignment. Though only assignments specifically noted as group assignments should be worked on with other people.</p>

<h3 id="makeup-and-late-policy">Makeup and Late policy</h3>

<p>Please notify the instructors of circumstances that lead to late work or missed classes. We will generally work with you and accept late work. Without prior notification, late work will be penalized one point per day after the due date.</p>

<h2 id="students-requiring-accommodations">Students Requiring Accommodations</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities requesting accommodations should first register with the Disability Resource Center (352-392-8565, <a href="https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/">https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/</a>) by providing appropriate documentation. Once registered, students will receive an accommodation letter which must be presented to the instructor when requesting accommodation. Students with disabilities should follow this procedure as early as possible in the semester.</p>

<h2 id="course-evaluation">Course Evaluation</h2>

<p>Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional and respectful manner is available at <a href="https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/">gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/</a>. Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or via <a href="https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/">ufl.bluera.com/ufl/</a>. Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at <a href="https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/">gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="class-demeanor-and-netiquette">Class Demeanor and Netiquette</h2>

<p>Students are expected to be in class or join the class Zoom meeting on time and behave in a manner that is respectful to the instructors and to fellow students. For remote participants, if at all possible, please have your video on during class–it is easier for us to teach and for discussion if we can see you! Please do be aware of your surroundings and ensure that content visible on your video, or shared via screen sharing, is appropriate for class.</p>

<p>Opinions held by other students should be respected in discussion, and conversations that do not contribute to the discussion should be held at minimum, if at all.</p>

<p>Students should be working on course content during class.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-boards-and-slack-channel">Discussion Boards and Slack Channel</h3>

<p>The Canvas discussion boards and Microsoft Teams can be used to ask for and provide help by all. Students should be supportive and considerate of others at all times. Rude or inappropriate comments will be removed and the poster will be warned.</p>

<h2 id="university-honesty-policy">University Honesty Policy</h2>

<p>UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: “On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://sccr.dso.ufl.edu/policies/student-honor-code-student-conduct-code/">The Honor Code</a> specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and the possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel.

<h2 id="statement-regarding-course-recording">Statement Regarding Course Recording</h2>

<p>Our class sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back to and for use of enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate verbally are agreeing to have their voices recorded.  If you are unwilling to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated.  As in all courses, unauthorized recording and unauthorized sharing of recorded materials is prohibited.</p>
