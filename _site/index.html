<figure><img class="docimage" src="images/ai_bio_cover.png" alt="Image of futuristic AI and Biological specimens" style="max-width: 400px" align="right" /></figure>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research has existed since at least the 1950s. After initial enthusiasm, the gains of early years slowed and AI entered what has been referred to as an AI winter. Modern computing hardware, rapid growth in data collection and availability, and advances in algorithms have renewed interest in AI and revolutionized the field. AI is rapidly becoming ubiquitous in daily life and in diverse academic fields. This course will examine the applications of AI with particular focus on applications in biology. We will address the topics of what AI is, how intelligent computers really are and may become, where limitations still exist, and how AI technologies can be used to advance biological research.</p>

<p>The course will attempt to provide sufficient background and foundations so that students understand AI algorithms at a conceptual level, but will not focus on the mathematical details. This is not a computer science or mathematics course.</p>

<p>Classes will have some lecture, though most classes will consist of live coding demos and hands-on exercises.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>BSC4452 or BSC6451 or BSC2891 or permission of instructor based on demonstration of prior Python programming experience.</p>

<h3 id="computer-programming">Computer programming</h3>

<p>The course assumes a <strong>basic understanding of computer programming</strong> in general, and Python in particular.</p>

<p>If you need a quick refresher, there are several LinkedIn Learning courses that will give you sufficient background to be ready for this course (these are free for UF Students):</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> Note, you do not need to do all of these. Any <strong>one</strong> would get you at a good place to start the semester. We will review the basics of Python in the first weeks.</div>

    <ul>
      <li>Another option for those with some coding experience</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="math">Math</h3>

<p>You should have a <strong>general understanding of probability and statistics</strong> at the level of a first applied statistics course.</p>

<p>Knowledge of basic calculus and, to a lesser extent, linear algebra, can be helpful. We won’t focus on the math, but having a conceptual understanding of derivatives, function optimization, and matrix math will be useful.</p>

<p>If you are unsure, contact the instructor.</p>

                Should a student wish to dispute any grade received in this class (other than simple addition errors), the dispute must be in writing (via email) and be submitted to the instructors within a week of receiving the grade.
                <br /><br />
                The dispute should clearly set out the grade that the student believes the assignment should have received as well as why they believe that they should have received such a grade.

                Some assignments may be resubmitted for revision. We may suggest a resubmission, or a student may ask for the opportunity to resubmit.

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>

<h3 id="class-attendance-and-makeup-policy">Class Attendance and Makeup Policy</h3>

<p>Requirements for class attendance and makeup assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found in the online catalog at: <a href="https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/">https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/</a></p>

<p>In general, we do not take attendance. You are all adults and we assume you are taking the class the learn. <strong>The best way to learn is to regularly attend class.</strong> We are sure students will miss class for various reasons. We are happy to help you catch up. If you regularly miss class and fall behind, we may ask that you hold questions on content you have missed until after class, or ask that you coordinate a time to go over the content. We will make every effort to record and post all classes to help those that miss classes.</p>

<h3 id="assignment-policy">Assignment Policy</h3>

<p>Assignment dates will be announced at least one week in advance and students will have at least three days to complete the assignment. Each assignment will clearly state if it is an individual or group assignment.  Individual assignments must be the student’s own work, completed without the assistance of others.</p>

<p>All assignments are “open book, open internet”, you may use whatever resources you desire to complete the assignment. Though only assignments specifically noted as group assignments should be worked on with other people.</p>

<h3 id="makeup-and-late-policy">Makeup and Late policy</h3>

<p>Please notify the instructors of circumstances that lead to late work or missed classes. We will generally work with you and accept late work. All assignments are designed for both your own learning and my assessment of your efforts. Much of the course builds on previous sections and falling behind on assignments will make it harder to keep up. If you need help, please ask! <strong>Our goal is for all students to learn the material</strong> and we understand that some students will need more help than others. The grade is based on the end product, not the amount of time and help needed to get there.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="students-requiring-accommodations">Students Requiring Accommodations</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities who experience learning barriers and would like to request academic accommodations should connect with the disability Resource Center. <a href="https://disability.ufl.edu/get-started/">Click here to get started with the Disability Resource Center</a>. It is important for students to share their accommodation letter with their instructor and discuss their access needs, as early as possible in the semester.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="course-evaluation">Course Evaluation</h2>

<p>Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional and respectful manner is available at <a href="https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/">gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/</a>. Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or via <a href="https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/">ufl.bluera.com/ufl/</a>. Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at <a href="https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/">gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="class-demeanor-and-netiquette">Class Demeanor and Netiquette</h2>

<p>Students are expected to be in class on time and behave in a manner that is respectful to the instructors and to fellow students.</p>

<p>Opinions held by other students should be respected in discussion, and conversations that do not contribute to the discussion should be held at minimum, if at all.</p>

<p>Students should be working on course content during class.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-boards">Discussion Boards</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/AIBiology/aibiology.github.io/discussions">GitHub discussion boards</a> can be used to ask for and provide help by all. Students should be supportive and considerate of others at all times. Rude or inappropriate comments will be removed and the poster will be warned.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="university-honesty-policy">University Honesty Policy</h2>

<p>UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: “On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.”
The Conduct Code specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and the possible sanctions. <a href="https://sccr.dso.ufl.edu/process/student-conduct-code/">Click here to read the Conduct Code</a>. If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with the instructor.</p>

## Statement Regarding Course Recording

Our class sessions may be audio visually recorded for students in the class to refer back to and for use of enrolled students who are unable to attend live. Students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate verbally are agreeing to have their voices recorded.  If you are unwilling to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated.  As in all courses, unauthorized recording and unauthorized sharing of recorded materials is prohibited.

Students are allowed to record video or audio of class lectures. However, the purposes for which these recordings may be used are strictly controlled.  The only allowable purposes are (1) for personal educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil proceeding.  All other purposes are prohibited.  Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor.

A “class lecture” is an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida course. A class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or guest lecturer during a class session.

Publication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To “publish” means to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code.

                <h3>Procedure for Conflict Resolution</h3>
                  Any classroom issues, disagreements or grade disputes should be discussed first between the instructor and the student. If the problem cannot be resolved, please contact the (Under)Graduate Coordinator or the Department Chair. Be prepared to provide documentation of the problem, as well as all graded materials for the semester. Issues that cannot be resolved departmentally will be referred to the University Ombuds Office (<a href="http://www.ombuds.ufl.edu">http://www.ombuds.ufl.edu</a>; 392-1308) or the Dean of Students Office (<a href="http://www.dso.ufl.edu">http://www.dso.ufl.edu</a>; 392-1261).
