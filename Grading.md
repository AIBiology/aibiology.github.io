Your grade in this course will be based on the following assignments.

All assignments are turned in using Canvas and all grades will only be recorded in Canvas.

## Problem sets

Problem sets are linked from Canvas, but generally use GitHub.com for the content of the answers. You will submit a link to the repository containing your code.

Problem sets are usually group assignments. **All members of the group must either be graduate students or undergraduate students.** It is expected that all members of the group will work together to create the answers. You may break up the work, or collaborate, but all should understand and agree with the answers being submitted. Problem sets can take a few hours to complete. You are welcome to use your notes, the textbooks, the class website or any other sources.

By working together in a group, my hope is that different members will think of different solutions. There are almost always different solutions. Any functional solution is fine.

{% include tip.html content="If your group is struggling to find an answer, **ask me for help**! Problem sets are supposed to challenge, not frustrate. I am happy to guide you to an answer. I will usually reply with some information, if that doesn't help, ask for more! I am usually not trying to be difficult, but trying to strike a balance between *guiding* you to an answer and *giving* you the answer." %}

## Project

There is a project for the course. This is not necessarily any harder or more involved than a problem set, but may take a bit more time as you  need to come up with an idea (guidelines will be provided) and write the code. Projects will also be group assignments. Again, I am more than happy to help at any stage of the project.

During the last week of class, each project group will present a short summary of their project to the class.
