## About the site

This site has been developed as the main repository for Brian Stucky and Matt Gitzendanner's AI in Biology course. This course is being offered for the first time Spring 2020 at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu). This site serves both as the primary resource when teaching the course, and as a resource for others teaching similar courses or learning on their own.

The course was designed to be a one semester, 3-credit course for upper-level undergraduate and starting graduate students.
