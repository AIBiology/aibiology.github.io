## Course Description

> Examines how Artificial Intelligence has rapidly become ubiquitous in daily life and been applied to diverse areas of Biology. Focuses on machine learning approaches as well as deep learning methods, including transformers. Covers machine learning methods for tabular data, computer vision, transfer learning, natural language processing, and transformer-based architectures. Classes are typically applied coding with Jupyter Notebooks on HiPerGator. Prior Python coding experience required.

## Expanded Description

{% include image.html max-width=400 file='ai_bio_cover.png' alt="Image of futuristic AI and Biological specimens" position="right" %}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a field of research has existed since at least the 1950s. After initial enthusiasm, the gains of early years slowed and AI entered what has been referred to as an AI winter. Modern computing hardware, rapid growth in data collection and availability, and advances in algorithms have renewed interest in AI and revolutionized the field. AI is rapidly becoming ubiquitous in daily life and in diverse academic fields. This course will examine the applications of AI with particular focus on applications in biology. We will address the topics of what AI is, how intelligent computers really are and may become, where limitations still exist, and how AI technologies can be used to advance biological research.

The course will attempt to provide sufficient background and foundations so that students understand AI algorithms at a conceptual level, but will not focus on the mathematical details. This is not a computer science or mathematics course. 

Classes will have some lecture, though most classes will consist of live coding demos and hands-on exercises.

## Prerequisites

BSC4452 or BSC6451 or BSC2891 or permission of instructor based on demonstration of prior Python programming experience.

### Computer programming

The course assumes a **basic understanding of computer programming** in general, and Python in particular.

If you need a quick refresher, there are several LinkedIn Learning courses that will give you sufficient background to be ready for this course (these are free for UF Students):
  {% include note.html content="Note, you do not need to do all of these. Any **one** would get you at a good place to start the semester. We will review the basics of Python in the first weeks." %}

* [Programming Foundations: Fundamentals](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fprogramming-foundations-fundamentals-3%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&account=41282748)
  * This course is best for people with no coding experience.
  * Most of the hands-on examples are in Python
* [Python Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2/welcome?u=41282748)
  * A good review or introduction for people who know some programming but not Python
* [Learning Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Flearning-python%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&account=41282748)
  * Another option for those with some coding experience

### Math

You should have a **general understanding of probability and statistics** at the level of a first applied statistics course.

Knowledge of basic calculus and, to a lesser extent, linear algebra, can be helpful. We won't focus on the math, but having a conceptual understanding of derivatives, function optimization, and matrix math will be useful.

If you are unsure, contact the instructor.

___

## Meeting Times

* **Mon, Wed, Fri from 1:55pm - 2:45pm in Bartram 211**

    {% include important.html content="You should make every effort to attend class synchronously. While we will record class sessions, **during class is the best opportunity to ask questions and get help from the instructors and others in the class.**" %}

* We understand that some students will need to miss classes sometimes. That is fine and we will do our best to help you catch up, but regular attendance is the best way to learn.

___
{% include custom/office_hours.html %}

 {% include tip.html content="Coding is not always easy. Simple solutions are not always obvious. There will be some frustration. <br>**We expect that you will need help. You should expect that you will need help.** <br>We want to help you! We cannot always help if you do not ask for the help you need. ***Please ask for help!***" %}

## Course Policies

### Class Attendance and Makeup Policy

Requirements for class attendance and makeup assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found in the online catalog at: [https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/)

In general, we do not take attendance. You are all adults and we assume you are taking the class the learn. **The best way to learn is to regularly attend class.** We are sure students will miss class for various reasons. We are happy to help you catch up. If you regularly miss class and fall behind, we may ask that you hold questions on content you have missed until after class, or ask that you coordinate a time to go over the content. We will make every effort to record and post all classes to help those that miss classes.

### Assignment Policy

Assignment dates will be announced at least one week in advance and students will have at least three days to complete the assignment. Each assignment will clearly state if it is an individual or group assignment.  Individual assignments must be the student’s own work, completed without the assistance of others.

All assignments are "open book, open internet", you may use whatever resources you desire to complete the assignment. Though only assignments specifically noted as group assignments should be worked on with other people.

### Makeup and Late policy

Please notify the instructors of circumstances that lead to late work or missed classes. We will generally work with you and accept late work. All assignments are designed for both your own learning and my assessment of your efforts. Much of the course builds on previous sections and falling behind on assignments will make it harder to keep up. If you need help, please ask! **Our goal is for all students to learn the material** and we understand that some students will need more help than others. The grade is based on the end product, not the amount of time and help needed to get there.

## Students Requiring Accommodations

Students with disabilities who experience learning barriers and would like to request academic accommodations should connect with the disability Resource Center. [Click here to get started with the Disability Resource Center](https://disability.ufl.edu/get-started/). It is important for students to share their accommodation letter with their instructor and discuss their access needs, as early as possible in the semester.

___

## Course Evaluation

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online. Students can complete evaluations in three ways:

1. The email they receive from GatorEvals,
1. Their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or
1. The central portal at [https://my-ufl.bluera.com](https://my-ufl.bluera.com)

Guidance on how to provide constructive feedback is available at [https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/). Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens. Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at[ https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/( https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/)].
___

## Class Demeanor and Netiquette

Students are expected to be in class on time and behave in a manner that is respectful to the instructors and to fellow students.

Opinions held by other students should be respected in discussion, and conversations that do not contribute to the discussion should be held at minimum, if at all.

Students should be working on course content during class.

### Discussion Boards

The [GitHub discussion boards](https://github.com/AIBiology/aibiology.github.io/discussions) can be used to ask for and provide help by all. Students should be supportive and considerate of others at all times. Rude or inappropriate comments will be removed and the poster will be warned.
